Procto
======

The main library [hsbeat](https://github.com/YaSuenag/hsbeat) is now archived, then I have to archive this project.

Find info about a process.

 * Find Java process ans dead its hsperf infos
 * Find stuck threads
 * Count sockets opened

The hard job is done by the hsbeat project.

Status : Cute and experimental POC.
